# GRACE Architecture Document

## Overview

GRACE (**G**enerative **R**easoning **A**nd **C**omprehension **E**ngine) is designed with a global-first architecture to ensure optimal performance for both developers and end-users worldwide. This document outlines the architectural decisions, component interactions, and deployment strategy.

## Architecture Principles

- **Global Availability**: Ensure low-latency access worldwide
- **Developer Experience**: Optimize for efficient local development
- **Scalability**: Handle variable loads during judging and demonstrations
- **Security**: Implement AWS best practices for secure AI applications
- **Cost Efficiency**: Leverage serverless and pay-per-use services

## High-Level Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Frontend Application**
   - React-based SPA hosted on Amplify Hosting
   - Distributed globally via CloudFront
   - Responsive design for multiple device types

2. **API Layer**
   - GraphQL API powered by AWS AppSync
   - REST endpoints via API Gateway
   - WebSocket support for real-time features

3. **Compute Layer**
   - AWS Lambda for serverless processing
   - Step Functions for complex workflows
   - SageMaker for ML model hosting

4. **Data Layer**
   - DynamoDB for structured data
   - S3 for object storage
   - ElasticSearch for search capabilities

5. **AI/ML Components**
   - SageMaker for custom model training and hosting
   - Bedrock for foundation models
   - Comprehend for NLP tasks

## Global Distribution Strategy

### Development Region: eu-west-2 (London)
- Primary development region
- Closest to development team for lowest latency
- Houses main infrastructure components

### Content Delivery: CloudFront
- Global CDN with 410+ Points of Presence
- Automatic edge caching for static assets
- Dynamic content acceleration
- HTTPS enforcement and WAF integration

### Data Replication
- Global DynamoDB tables for multi-region data access
- S3 Cross-Region Replication for critical assets
- Aurora Global Database for relational data (if needed)

## Deployment Pipeline

1. **Source Control**: GitHub repository
2. **CI/CD**: AWS Amplify Continuous Deployment
   - Automatic builds on push to main branch
   - Preview environments for pull requests
   - Post-deployment testing
3. **Infrastructure as Code**: AWS CDK or Amplify CLI
   - Version-controlled infrastructure
   - Reproducible environments
   - Simplified resource provisioning

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Amazon Cognito for user management
- **Authorization**: Fine-grained access control with AppSync and IAM
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch for logs and metrics
- **Compliance**: Adherence to relevant standards

## Scalability Design

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Serverless architecture scales automatically
- **Performance Optimization**: 
  - CloudFront caching strategies
  - DynamoDB auto-scaling
  - Lambda provisioned concurrency for critical functions
- **Cost Management**: 
  - Resource tagging
  - Budget alerts
  - Right-sizing recommendations

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
   - Set up Amplify project
   - Configure CloudFront distribution
   - Implement basic authentication

2. **Phase 2: AI Integration**
   - Connect to AWS AI services
   - Implement core reasoning capabilities
   - Develop comprehension features

3. **Phase 3: Enhanced Features**
   - Add real-time collaboration
   - Implement advanced analytics
   - Optimize for global performance

4. **Phase 4: Testing & Optimization**
   - Performance testing from multiple regions
   - Security audits
   - Cost optimization

## Conclusion

The GRACE architecture leverages AWS global infrastructure to provide a high-performance, scalable solution accessible to users worldwide. By utilizing Amplify and CloudFront as core components, we ensure that both development experience and end-user experience are optimized regardless of geographic location.

This architecture supports the project's goals for the Code with Kiro Hackathon while demonstrating best practices in cloud-native application development.
