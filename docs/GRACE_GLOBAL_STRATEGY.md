# GRACE Global Strategy

This document outlines the global strategy for the GRACE project, focusing on how AWS Amplify and CloudFront enable worldwide accessibility while maintaining optimal performance for both UK-based development and US-based judging.

## Global Challenges

The GRACE project faces unique geographical challenges:

1. **Development Team**: Based near London, UK
2. **Judging Panel**: Primarily based in the United States
3. **Potential Users**: Could be located worldwide

These challenges require a thoughtful approach to infrastructure design and deployment to ensure consistent performance across regions.

## CloudFront as a Global Accelerator

### How CloudFront Addresses Our Challenges

CloudFront serves as the cornerstone of our global strategy by:

1. **Edge Location Proximity**
   - 410+ Points of Presence (PoPs) worldwide
   - 90+ cities across 47 countries
   - Significant presence in both UK and US regions

2. **Content Caching**
   - Static assets cached at edge locations
   - Reduced latency for repeat visitors
   - Customizable caching behaviors

3. **Dynamic Content Acceleration**
   - Optimized connections to origin servers
   - Persistent connections reduce TCP handshake overhead
   - SSL termination at edge

4. **Security Benefits**
   - DDoS protection
   - AWS Shield integration
   - AWS WAF compatibility

## Regional Strategy

### Primary Development Region: eu-west-2 (London)

- **Justification**: Closest to development team
- **Benefits**: 
  - Reduced latency during development
  - Faster deployments and testing
  - Compliance with UK/EU data regulations (if applicable)

### Global Distribution via CloudFront

- **US Edge Locations**: 
  - 94+ PoPs across the United States
  - Ensures low-latency access for judges
  - Automatic routing to nearest edge location

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Average latency reduction: 30-60%
  - Time to First Byte (TTFB) improvement: 40-80%
  - Global availability: 99.9%

## Data Considerations

### Data Storage Strategy

1. **Static Content**:
   - Stored in S3 buckets in eu-west-2
   - Distributed via CloudFront
   - No replication needed due to CloudFront caching

2. **Dynamic Data**:
   - Primary database in eu-west-2
   - Consider global tables for DynamoDB if write latency becomes an issue
   - Read replicas for relational databases (if needed)

3. **User-Generated Content**:
   - Stored in nearest region when possible
   - Metadata in global tables
   - Objects in regional S3 buckets

## Cost-Performance Balance

### Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **CloudFront Pricing Considerations**:
   - Data transfer costs vary by region
   - Price Class selection based on required coverage
   - Cache optimization to reduce origin requests

2. **Regional vs. Global Resources**:
   - Single-region deployment for most backend services
   - Global distribution only for user-facing components
   - Selective multi-region deployment for critical services

### Performance Optimization

1. **Cache Strategy**:
   - Aggressive caching for static assets (1 year+)
   - Appropriate cache control for API responses
   - Cache invalidation strategy for updates

2. **Origin Response Optimization**:
   - Compression (Gzip/Brotli)
   - Response time monitoring
   - Connection pooling

## Implementation with Amplify

AWS Amplify simplifies the implementation of this global strategy by:

1. **Automated CloudFront Configuration**:
   - Proper cache behaviors
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - Custom domain support

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Automatic deployments to global infrastructure
   - Preview environments for testing
   - Branch-based deployments

3. **Simplified Resource Management**:
   - Infrastructure as Code
   - Environment variables management
   - Service coordination

## Monitoring and Optimization

1. **Global Performance Monitoring**:
   - CloudWatch Synthetics canaries from multiple regions
   - Real User Monitoring (RUM)
   - Regional performance dashboards

2. **Continuous Optimization**:
   - A/B testing of configuration changes
   - Performance budget enforcement
   - Regular review of CloudFront analytics

## Conclusion

By leveraging AWS Amplify and CloudFront, the GRACE project achieves an optimal balance between development convenience (UK-based) and global accessibility (particularly for US-based judges). This strategy ensures that regardless of geographic location, users experience consistent, low-latency access to the application while maintaining cost efficiency and operational simplicity.
