# GRACE Project Conventions

## Architectural Principles

1. **Global-First Design**
   - All user-facing components must be globally distributed via CloudFront
   - Static content must be cached at edge locations
   - Dynamic data must be fetched via direct API calls to the primary region (eu-west-2)

2. **API Design**
   - All APIs must be implemented as REST endpoints using Amazon API Gateway
   - All API Gateway endpoints must use Lambda Proxy Integration
   - API resources must follow resource-oriented design principles
   - HTTP methods must be used appropriately (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

3. **Frontend Development**
   - React must be used as the frontend framework
   - Component-based architecture must be followed
   - React hooks must be preferred over class components
   - State management must use React Context API or Redux

4. **Backend Processing**
   - Complex workflows must be orchestrated using AWS Step Functions
   - Each step in a workflow must be implemented as a discrete Lambda function
   - Lambda functions must follow the single responsibility principle
   - Cross-cutting concerns must be implemented using Lambda Layers

5. **Data Management**
   - Primary data region must be eu-west-2 (London)
   - Cross-region data access must be implemented via direct API calls
   - Advanced caching strategies are deferred as future improvements
   - All data must be encrypted at rest and in transit

6. **Security Practices**
   - Authentication must be implemented using Amazon Cognito
   - Authorization must follow the principle of least privilege
   - All API endpoints must be secured with appropriate IAM policies
   - Sensitive data must never be exposed in logs or frontend code

7. **Deployment Strategy**
   - All infrastructure must be defined as code using AWS CDK
   - CI/CD pipelines must be implemented using AWS Amplify
   - Environment-specific configurations must be managed using parameter stores
   - Blue/green deployment strategy must be used for production updates

8. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - All Lambda functions must emit structured logs
   - Custom metrics must be published for business-critical operations
   - Dashboards must be created for key performance indicators
   - Alerts must be configured for anomaly detection
