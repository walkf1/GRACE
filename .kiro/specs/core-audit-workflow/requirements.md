# Core Audit Workflow Requirements

## Functional Requirements in EARS Notation

### User Authentication
1. WHEN a user attempts to access the GRACE system, THE SYSTEM SHALL authenticate the user using Amazon Cognito.
2. WHEN a user is authenticated, THE SYSTEM SHALL provide a JWT token for subsequent API requests.
3. WHEN a user's session expires, THE SYSTEM SHALL redirect the user to the login page.

### Audit Request Submission
1. WHEN a user submits an audit request, THE SYSTEM SHALL validate the input data format.
2. WHEN an audit request is received, THE SYSTEM SHALL generate a unique audit ID.
3. WHEN an audit request is validated, THE SYSTEM SHALL initiate the audit workflow using Step Functions.
4. WHEN an audit request contains invalid data, THE SYSTEM SHALL return appropriate error messages.

### Audit Processing
1. WHEN an audit workflow starts, THE SYSTEM SHALL record the start time and requester information.
2. WHEN processing an audit, THE SYSTEM SHALL execute each step in the defined sequence.
3. WHEN a step in the audit workflow fails, THE SYSTEM SHALL record the failure reason and notify the user.
4. WHEN all audit steps complete successfully, THE SYSTEM SHALL mark the audit as complete.

### Data Verification
1. WHEN verifying data, THE SYSTEM SHALL check for data integrity using cryptographic methods.
2. WHEN data verification succeeds, THE SYSTEM SHALL proceed to the next step in the workflow.
3. WHEN data verification fails, THE SYSTEM SHALL terminate the workflow and report the failure.

### Results Storage
1. WHEN audit results are generated, THE SYSTEM SHALL store them in the QLDB ledger.
2. WHEN storing audit results, THE SYSTEM SHALL include metadata about the audit process.
3. WHEN audit results are stored, THE SYSTEM SHALL make them available for retrieval via API.

### Results Retrieval
1. WHEN a user requests audit results, THE SYSTEM SHALL verify the user has appropriate permissions.
2. WHEN retrieving audit results, THE SYSTEM SHALL fetch data from the primary region (eu-west-2).
3. WHEN displaying audit results, THE SYSTEM SHALL present them in a user-friendly format.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
1. WHEN serving static content, THE SYSTEM SHALL deliver assets within 100ms to users worldwide.
2. WHEN processing an audit request, THE SYSTEM SHALL complete the workflow within 30 seconds.
3. WHEN fetching audit results, THE SYSTEM SHALL return data within 2 seconds.

### Scalability
1. WHEN under peak load, THE SYSTEM SHALL handle at least 100 concurrent audit requests.
2. WHEN traffic increases, THE SYSTEM SHALL scale automatically without manual intervention.

### Security
1. WHEN storing sensitive data, THE SYSTEM SHALL encrypt the data at rest.
2. WHEN transmitting data, THE SYSTEM SHALL use TLS 1.2 or higher.
3. WHEN logging operations, THE SYSTEM SHALL exclude personally identifiable information.

### Availability
1. WHEN operating normally, THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime.
2. WHEN a regional failure occurs, THE SYSTEM SHALL continue serving static content from CloudFront.
